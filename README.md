# Vige & Co. - Hair Salon Website

This is a website for a fictional salon. I built this to practice my HTML and CSS skills after completing a few classes in [#100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/).

### What I learned

By building this website, I learned how to use custom CSS properties, flexbox layout, and use media queries for responsiveness. 

### Useful resources

- [Pure CSS 3D Coverflow Image Slider](https://codeconvey.com/pure-css-coverflow-slider/) - This helped me for making the gallery-like slider in the lookbook section of the website.
- [Pure CSS Responsive Menu](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/MWEJEWG?editors=1100) - This helped me in making the navigation menu for the mobile page.
